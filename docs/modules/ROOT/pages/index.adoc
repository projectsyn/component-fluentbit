= fluentbit

fluentbit is a Commodore component to manage fluent-bit using the official
https://hub.helm.sh/charts/fluent/fluent-bit[fluent/fluent-bit helm chart].

The component adds a custom annotation `checksum/syn-config` to the PodSpec of the fluent-bit DaemonSet.
This ensures that the fluent-bit pods are restarted when the configuration managed by the component changes.

See the xref:references/parameters.adoc[parameters] reference for further details.
